# Blobments Prototype

Simple game made using c++ in unreal engine.

Click and hold to power up jump.  If you hold for long enough bob becomes red and can kill enemies.
If you click on land bob will maintain momentum.  

I wanted to solidify my skills in C++ so I decided to use coding instead of blueprints for this project.

All the c++ code is found in GitHub\Blobments-Prototype\Source\BlobmentsV1

no health bars, missing drum beat, movement bug after death.
