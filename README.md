# Blobments Prototype

Simple game made using c++ in unreal engine.

I wanted to solidify my skills in C++ so I decided to use coding instead of blueprints for this project.

All the c++ code is found in GitHub\Blobments-Prototype\Source\BlobmentsV1

Packaged project found in the packaged project folder

Bug in the movement at the moment that stops bob from moving fluently.
