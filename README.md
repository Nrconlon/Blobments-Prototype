Simple game made using c++ in unreal engine.

Click and hold to power up jump.  If you hold for long enough bob becomes red and can kill enemies.
If you click on land bob will maintain momentum.  

I wanted to solidify my skills in C++ so I decided to use coding instead of blueprints for this project.
The art and animation is left up to the blueprints so that artists can eddit without the use of code.

All the c++ code is found in GitHub\Blobments-Prototype\Source\BlobmentsV1
Most of the code is in BlobmentsV1Character.cpp

Enemies move to the "Drum" 

no health bars, missing drum beat, movement bug after death.
